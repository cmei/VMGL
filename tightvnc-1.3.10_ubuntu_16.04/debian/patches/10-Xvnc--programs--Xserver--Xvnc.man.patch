 .SH BUGS
 There are many security problems in current Xvnc implementation. It's
 recommended to restrict network access to Xvnc servers from untrusted
-network adresses. Probably, the best way to secure Xvnc server is to
+network addresses. Probably, the best way to secure Xvnc server is to
 allow only loopback connections from the server machine (the
 \fI\-localhost\fR option) and to use SSH tunneling for remote access
 to the Xvnc server. For details on SSH tunneling, see
