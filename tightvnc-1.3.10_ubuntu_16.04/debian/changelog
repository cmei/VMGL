  * control (vncserver): Added dependency on xbase because xauth is used in
    vncserver script (David Karlin) and fixed a small typo (lintian).
  * Xvnc/programs/Xserver/hw/vnc/rfbserver.c: Fixed memory leak (#27624).
  * Xvnc/config/cf/Imake.cf: Added Arm, Sparc, PowerPC architecture.

      vncserver is now the X server.
